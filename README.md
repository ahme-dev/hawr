# Hawr

A webapp for limited viewing of weather forecasts, in kurdish.

Using Vite + React hosted on [Netlify](https://hawr.netlify.app/) with icons from [icons8](https://icons8.com/) ♥️


Currently only supports status and temprature of the current day and next two. This will likely not be amended, due to free api limitations.
